# Extended Statistical Programming - Group Projects

# Welcome!

Hello Vincent and Sharon! Welcome to our extended statistical programming course repository!  
This **README.md** file highlights some important information about this course.

# Course Information Highlights

- **Coding language:** R
- **Grades:** 100% Assignments, no exams.
- **Assignment submission:** Every 2 weeks | 3 Group projects and 2 individual projects.
- **Aim:** Avoid over-reliance on any particular set of packages. The point is not to learn the quickest way to perform the particular task, but rather to illustrate how to programme.
- **Notice:** Avoid any possible mistakes !!! It's different from a written exam. In a written exam you can get some marks for answering part of the question, but in the coding projects, some mistakes will fail the whole code. 

# Ending
If you have any questions, feel easy to raise the questions in the group chat, or piazza. You can also ask the professor or ask other classmates. There are many resources to learn programming. Please try to solve the problem.
